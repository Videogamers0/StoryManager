Some ideas for future improvements:

- Setting to auto-mark stories as 'Read' when user reaches the bottom scroll offset
- Additional settings to change sorting?
    Sort groupbox: List of options, can drag/drop to re-order
        A-Z, Download Date, Authored Date, Last Viewed, Your Rating etc
- Custom bookmarks
    Click a button 'Save bookmark' (use the same icon that Literotica uses for bookmarks) to store the current scroll offset as a numbered bookmark for the selected story
    Bookmarks are auto-deleted / un-loadable if they were created with a different WebView2 width, 
        since the width of the viewer dictates what content is visible at a particular vertical scroll offset
- UI for finding stories that are related to the selected story
- Story importer? Must manually fill in the story metadata, and some features would need to be refactored 
    such as clicking the Title to open story in browser since the base address would be different
    Could also have 2-tabbed UI. Tab #1: Literotica. Tab #2: Other
    Other tab would be a simplified copy of the code used for the Literotica tab.
- Story filter settings could have a checkbox list of categories to show/hide
